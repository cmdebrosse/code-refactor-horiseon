  <h1 align="center">Code Refactoring</h1>

  > **Created by Chuck DeBrosse**

  ### Description
  This is my first challenge at attempting to refactor HTML and CSS files to make them more efficient and concise.
  While the look of the final product didn't change I managed to rather significantly reduce the lines of code.
